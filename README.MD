## Hypothesis

The observed trends in Baltimore City's neighborhoods suggest hypotheses for the varying crime rates. In areas experiencing increasing crime, economic disparities, higher population density, and a potential lack of effective community engagement may contribute. Meanwhile, neighborhoods with decreasing crime may benefit from successful community policing initiatives, economic development efforts, and improved infrastructure. The impact of demographic changes and law enforcement strategies on crime rates could also be significant across all neighborhoods. Further investigation into these factors, both individually and in combination, is essential for a nuanced understanding of the dynamics influencing crime trends in Baltimore.
